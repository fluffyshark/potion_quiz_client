Web app built with React to increase student engagement in lessons through subject-independent competitions.
The app uses an alchemical theme, and students answer questions to earn coins, which they spend on ingredients
to brew magical elixirs. The web app is split between a React client and an Express server. Both parts are hosted
on an AWS Ubuntu instance. The parts communicate via socket.io. Redux is used as a global store in the client part.
The web app uses Axios to fetch quizzes from the Quiz Editor's database
